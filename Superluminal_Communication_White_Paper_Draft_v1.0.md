### A Theoretical Framework for Superluminal Communication via Actively Generated Spacetime Singularities

---

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a novel theoretical model for communication. It is predicated on a central hypothesis: the process of quantum measurement is not a passive "collapse" of a wave function, but rather an active generation of an instantaneous, microscopic Laurent series singularity on the local spacetime manifold, occurringfantasy the observer interacts with the observed system. We derive the relationship between the energy of this singularity signal, `E_s`, the observer's energy, `E_c`, and the rest energy of the observed system, `E_0`, as: `E_s = E_c² / E_0`. This quadratic relationship reveals a controllable energy amplification mechanism. Furthermore, we propose that the detection of this signal can be achieved by a macroscopic system precisely tuned to a Quantum Critical Point (QCP). This receiver model transforms the detection threshold from a fixed energy barrier into a designable trigger, highly sensitive to structural symmetry breaking. This theory provides a self-consistent and experimentally verifiable new path for superluminal, non-local communication.

*   2.1 The Wave Function as a Potential Spectrum Described by a Taylor Series
*   2.2 The Observer as a Structured Boundary Condition
*   2.3 The Emergence of Laurent Series and Singularities: From `Ψ(z) = Σ a_n(z-c)ⁿ` to `f(z) = Σ a_n(z-c)ⁿ, n∈ℤ`
*   2.4 The Origin of the Born Rule: Probability Amplitude as the Residue of the Singularity

**3. Derivation of the Signal Energy**

**4. The Receiver Model: A Quantum Critical Detector (QCD)**
*   4.1 Redefining the Detection Threshold: From Energy Barrier to State Trigger
*   4.2 The Quantum Critical Point as an Ideal Signal-to-Noise Ratio System
*   4.3 Candidate Physical Systems: Heavy-fermion materials, high-temperature superconductors, topological insulators, etc.
*   4.4 Entanglement Enhancement: As a a-stage module for signal amplification

**5. Preliminary Discussion on Experimental Verification**
*   5.1 The Emitter: Precision collision experiments between high-energy photons and low-mass particle targets (e.g., electron-positron pairs).
*   5.2 The Receiver: A precisely tuned Quantum Critical Detector placed in the vicinity of the emitter.
*   5.3 The Signal to be Measured: A non-local, macroscopic state transition in the detector, occurring instantaneously with the collision, that is uncorrelated with any known physical processes.

**6. Conclusion and Outlook**
The MSG-QCD model proposed herein provides a complete, self-consistent theoretical loop for superluminal communication. It unifies core concepts from quantum mechanics, general relativity, and condensed matter physics under a novel framework. We call upon experimental physicists to design and conduct verification experiments based on the proposal outlined in this paper. If confirmed, this will not only herald a new era of communication but also fundamentally alter our understanding of mass, spacetime, and consciousness.
