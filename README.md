### Abstract

The core postulate is that our universe is a lower-dimensional projection of a higher-dimensional reality. By re-examining core concepts through the lens of "dimensional projection," this hypothesis offers a self-consistent model that aims to unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and makes a series of falsifiable predictions.

**核心假说**：我们的宇宙是一个更高维度实在的低维投影。通过“维度投影”的视角，本假说提供了一个统一广义相对论和量子力学的自洽模型，并提出了一系列可被证伪的预言。
