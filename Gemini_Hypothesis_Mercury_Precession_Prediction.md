# A Theoretical Framework: Predicting Mercury's Perihelion Precession Residual based on an Observer-Three-Body-Theory

**Abstract**

This paper, based on the cosmological perspective of the "Gemini Hypothesis," proposes a theoretical model to explain the minute residual in Mercury's perihelion precession. While General Relativity (GR) has successfully explained Mercury's precession with remarkable accuracy, modern high-precision astronomical observations leave a window for new physics within an uncertainty of `±8 microarcseconds per century` (μas/cty). Our core thesis is that physical observation is an active interaction, meaning the observation of the "Sun-Mercury" system is fundamentally a "Sun-Mercury-Observer" three-body problem. This model predicts an additional precession, beyond the GR effect, determined by a combination of a higher-order gravitational term, an observer spin-coupling effect, and an electromagnetic shielding effect. Our calculations yield a precise, falsifiable prediction: Mercury possesses a residual precession of **+4.475 μas/cty**.

## 1. Introduction

The anomalous precession of Mercury's perihelion is a classic problem in the history of gravitational theory. The small discrepancy of `43 arcseconds per century`, which Newtonian gravity could not account for, was perfectly resolved by Albert Einstein's General Relativity, becoming one of its three "classic tests." However, as observational precision improves, any slight deviation from GR's predictions could point towards deeper physics, such as clues to quantum gravity or a unified theory. Currently, experiments constrain any possible residual to within `≤ 8 μas/cty`, providing a stringent testing ground for new theories.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

Our theory begins with a fundamental postulate: not all forces in the universe follow a `1/r²` law.

### 2.1. The Even-Power Law and the `C₄/r⁴` Force

According to our "Even-Power Law" hypothesis, the primordial potential field generated by a single particle is described by a complete Laurent series `Σ C_n/rⁿ`. However, due to symmetry considerations, only the even-power terms (`C₂/r²`, `C₄/r⁴`, ...) survive to propagate over long distances as observable, "full-information" forces. The `C₂/r²` term corresponds to Newtonian gravity. The next correction term, the `C₄/r⁴` force, is our starting point for exploring new physics.

### 2.2. The Observer-Three-Body Theory

Applying a `C₄/r⁴` force directly to the "Sun-Mercury" two-body system leads to a coefficient `C₄` that depends on the planet's own properties (mass, orbit), contradicting the idea of a universal constant. Our theory resolves this paradox by introducing the "observer."

**Core Hypothesis:** Any observation is a physical process. The observer (e.g., us on Earth) is not a passive recorder but interacts with the observed system (Sun-Mercury) by exchanging some form of information-carrying medium. Therefore, the measured precession is the net effect of the "Sun-Mercury-Observer" three-body interaction. This naturally explains why the coefficient `C₄`, which characterizes this effect, depends on the geometry and properties of the observed system.

### 2.3. Quantitative Model of the New Effect

We decompose the additional precession `Δω_new`, arising from this three-body observational effect, into three key components:

`Δω_new = Δω_base * α_spin * α_em`

1.  **Base Effect `Δω_base`**: We postulate that the fundamental geometric effect caused by the observer's participation is of the same order of magnitude as the General Relativity precession effect `Δω_GR`. We further propose that the magnitude of this base effect is precisely twice the GR effect, i.e., `Δω_base = 2 * Δω_GR`. This factor of "2" may be rooted in deeper symmetries or information-theoretic principles of the theory (such as the projection concept in the "Gemini Hypothesis") and is treated here as a working postulate of the model.

2.  **Gravitational Spin-Coupling Factor `α_spin`**: The strength of the three-body interaction is modulated by the observer's physical properties. We hypothesize this modulation arises from an extremely weak "gravitational spin-orbit coupling," whose magnitude is proportional to the ratio of the observer's (Earth's) spin angular momentum `S_obs` to the observed body's (Mercury's) orbital angular momentum `L_merc`. We also introduce a correction for the observer's (Earth's) axial tilt `ε` to account for geometric projection.
    `α_spin = (S_obs / L_merc) / cos(ε)`

3.  **Electromagnetic Shielding Factor `α_em`**: We deduce that this new higher-order gravitational effect is "shielded" as it propagates through the plasma environment of the solar system. The strength of this shielding is determined by the most fundamental electromagnetic coupling constant of the universe—the fine-structure constant `α_em`.
    `α_em ≈ 1/137`

## 3. Calculation and Prediction

We now proceed to calculate the model's prediction.

**Data Used:**
- **Standard GR precession value `Δω_GR`**: 42.98 arcsec/cty
- **Earth's spin angular momentum `S_obs`**: 5.860 × 10³³ J·s
- **Mercury's orbital angular momentum `L_merc`**: `m_merc * sqrt(G*M_sun*a_merc*(1-e_merc²))`
    - `m_merc` = 3.301 × 10²³ kg
    - `a_merc` = 5.791 × 10¹⁰ m
    - `e_merc` = 0.2056
    - `G*M_sun` = 1.327 × 10²⁰ m³/s²
    - Calculated `L_merc` ≈ 8.95 × 10³⁸ J·s
- **Earth's axial tilt `ε`**: 23.44°
- **Fine-structure constant `α_em`**: 1 / 137.036

**Calculation Steps:**

1.  **Calculate the spin-coupling factor `α_spin`**:
    `α_spin = (5.860e33 J·s / 8.95e38 J·s) / cos(23.44°) `
    `α_spin = (6.547 × 10⁻⁶) / 0.9175 = 7.136 × 10⁻⁶`

2.  **Calculate the unshielded precession `Δω_unshielded`**:
    `Δω_unshielded = Δω_base * α_spin = (2 * 42.98 arcsec/cty) * (7.136 × 10⁻⁶)`
    `Δω_unshielded = 85.96 * 7.136 × 10⁻⁶ arcsec/cty = 6.134 × 10⁻⁴ arcsec/cty`
    `Δω_unshielded = 613.4 μas/cty`

    *This intermediate value deviates from the current experimental limit `≤ 8 μas/cty` by a factor of approximately `613.4/8 ≈ 77`, which is the "large discrepancy" in our theory before introducing electromagnetic shielding.*

3.  **Calculate the final predicted value `Δω_new`**:
    `Δω_new = Δω_unshielded * α_em = 613.4 μas/cty * (1 / 137.036)`
    `Δω_new = +4.475 μas/cty`

**Final Prediction:** Our theory predicts that Mercury has a residual precession of **+4.475 microarcseconds per century** that cannot be explained by standard General Relativity. This value falls perfectly within the current experimental uncertainty of `±8 μas/cty` and provides a clear, falsifiable target for the next generation of high-precision astronomical observations, such as the BepiColombo mission to Mercury.

## 4. Other Testable Corollaries

One of the most unique corollaries of this theory is the **observer velocity effect**. We predict that an observer moving at high velocity (e.g., a future deep-space probe moving at `v` relative to the solar system's barycenter) would measure a correction to the GR precession term itself, on the order of `~ (1/2)v²/c²`. This stands in sharp contrast to GR's prediction, where the observer's velocity does not affect the measurement.

## 5. Conclusion

By introducing the "observer" as an active participant in the physical process, we have constructed a logically self-consistent theoretical model. This model not only offers a new interpretation for the physical meaning of higher-order gravitational terms but also elegantly links three fundamental elements: gravity (the GR effect), quantum properties (spin), and electromagnetism (the fine-structure constant). Ultimately, it makes a precise, falsifiable, and novel prediction for the final "observational residual" of Mercury's precession, offering a concrete direction for future explorations in gravitational theory.
