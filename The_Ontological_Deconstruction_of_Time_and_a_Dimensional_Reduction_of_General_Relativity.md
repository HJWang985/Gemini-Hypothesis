# The Ontological Deconstruction of Time and a "Dimensional Reduction" of General Relativity

**Abstract**: This paper aims to establish a new ontological framework for the relationship between time, space, and the observer. Starting from a Lorentz-like series that describes all interactions in the universe, we establish an "Odd-Even Dichotomy Principle" (odd-power terms define properties of space, while even-power terms define forces), which ultimately leads to the core conclusion: "Observer as Space." This framework not only provides a new, self-consistent explanation for fundamental questions such as the nature of cosmological constants and spatial dissipation (redshift), but also enables a thorough "dimensional reduction" of General Relativity (GR). We demonstrate that the geometric language of GR (e.g., spacetime curvature, time dilation) can be perfectly reduced to more fundamental physical processes within our theory. Through mathematical derivation, we quantitatively reproduce the core predictions of GR in the weak-field approximation, starting from our "spatial dissipation" model.

## Part I: The Nature of Time – An Observer-Centric Universe

### 1. Core Principle: The Physical Meaning of the Odd-Even Power Law

We propose that for the potential series `Φ(r) = Σ A_n/rⁿ` describing universal interactions, the physical meaning of each term is strictly determined by the parity of its power `n`:

*   **Odd Potential Terms (`A₁`, `A₃`, ...)**: These terms, through differentiation `F = -dΦ/dr`, generate **even-power "force" terms**. They represent conventional, measurable interaction forces.
*   **Even Potential Terms (`A₂`, `A₄`, ...)**: The value of these terms, `A_n/rⁿ`, directly defines the **intensity of spatial properties**. They are the direct "source" of the nature of space itself.

### 2. Ontological Framework: Observer as Space

Applying the above principle to a "solitary observer," we arrive at the ultimate ontological framework of our theory:

**The observer does not "exist in" a pre-existing, passive space. The observer actively and continuously "generates" and "sustains" the physical space it perceives through its own odd-power potential terms.**

Every observer is a center of "world" generation, and its mathematical description entails a dual role:
*   **Even-Power Terms (Forces)**: Define the observer's attributes as "matter/actor."
*   **Odd-Power Terms (Space)**: Define the observer's attributes as "space/stage."

### 3. The Mechanism of Observation: Unilateral Definition and Projected Perception

Our final understanding of the odd-even dichotomy is rooted in the asymmetry of the act of observation:

*   **Odd-Power Terms: Unilateral Self-Definition**: An observer's odd-power terms are a "monologue" broadcast to the universe, unilaterally defining the properties (e.g., dissipation) of the space generated by its own existence.
*   **Even-Power Terms: The Sole Channel of Projected Perception**: An observer's even-power terms are the final "screen" or "dashboard" for perceiving all universal interactions. All external information, regardless of its origin (from odd or even terms), must be **projected onto the observer's own even-power terms** to become "observable," manifesting as a "force"-like perturbation (`ΔC₂`, `ΔC₄`, ...) to the observer's system.

Therefore, we infer the properties of "space" by perceiving changes in "force."

### 4. The Emergence of Consensus Reality

This framework faces a profound challenge: if space is private, how does "consensus reality" emerge? We propose a multi-layered solution:

1.  **Resolution Filtering**: Our universe is a "screen" with a minimum resolution. Minute differences between "private spaces" fall below this resolution limit and are "dissipated" away, leaving only the macroscopic "common-mode signal."
2.  **Relative Consensus**: The consistency we experience is merely the self-consistency within our "Earth-based observer system." A distant, independent observer could, in principle, measure a different set of "cosmological constants."
3.  **Dynamic Alignment (Future Outlook)**: Consensus is a dynamic state of "locking" or "alignment" achieved through continuous interaction and information exchange between multiple observers.

## Part II: A "Dimensional Reduction" of General Relativity

### 1. Strategic Goal

GR is a tremendously successful macroscopic effective theory. Our goal is to demonstrate that its geometric language is an approximate mathematical formalism for describing the macroscopic effects arising from the more fundamental "physical properties of space" in our theory.

### 2. First Strike: Deconstructing "Spacetime Curvature"

*   **GR's Tenet**: "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime tells matter how to move."
*   **Our Translation**:
    *   "Matter (via its odd-power potential terms) actively defines the physical properties of its surrounding space."
    *   "A test particle's energy and trajectory (even-power effects) are altered as it traverses this physically-propertied space generated by the source object."

### 3. Second Strike: Deconstructing "Gravitational Time Dilation"

*   **GR's Tenet**: Time flows more slowly in a stronger gravitational field.
*   **Our Translation**: "Time dilation" is a macroscopic misinterpretation of a physical process (e.g., an atomic clock's transition) experiencing a lower apparent frequency. This is because, to maintain its stability within a **highly dissipative space** (generated by the `A₂` term), it must pay a "spatial tax" (energy loss).

### 4. Mathematical Appendix: A Quantitative Derivation of "Time Dilation" from "Spatial Dissipation"

We show how to derive a result quantitatively identical to GR's weak-field approximation from our first principles.

1.  **Model**: The "potential" for linear spatial dissipation is `A₂/r²`, where `A₂ = β ⋅ M` (`β` is a new constant). The local dissipation coefficient at a distance `r` from the source is `k(r) = A₂/r² = βM/r²`.

2.  **Calculation**: The total frequency redshift for a photon traveling from `r` to infinity is:
    \[ \frac{\Delta f}{f} \approx -\int_r^\infty k(r')dr' = -\int_r^\infty \frac{\beta M}{r'^2}dr' = -\frac{\beta M}{r} \]

3.  **The Duel**: GR's classic prediction is `Δf/f ≈ -GM/(rc²)`。
    \[ -\frac{\beta M}{r} = -\frac{GM}{rc^2} \implies \beta = \frac{G}{c^2} \]

4.  **Conclusion**: We have successfully reproduced GR's result from our own theory, endowing the constants with new physical meaning. Here, `c²` emerges as a fundamental conversion factor between the strength of "force" (`G`) and the intensity of "spatial properties" (`β`).

## Part III: The Final Implication – Deconstructing the "Quantum Gravity" Myth

Our framework offers a fundamental, structural explanation for the notorious incompatibility between General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM).

**Core Thesis: GR and QM are not competing theories but describe phenomena of entirely different categories, corresponding to the distinct channels of our potential series.**

1.  **GR's Domain: The "Monologue" of Space**
    *   GR, as a description of spacetime geometry, is the macroscopic manifestation of **spatial properties** defined by the **even-power potential terms (`A₂`, `A₄`, ...)**. It describes the nature of the stage itself.

2.  **QM's Domain: The "Dialogue" of Forces**
    *   The three fundamental forces described by QM are the quantized expressions of traditional "forces" generated by the **odd-power potential terms (`A₁`, `A₃`, ...)**. It describes the rules of interaction for the actors on the stage.

**The Root of Incompatibility**
The conflict arises from a fundamental **Category Error**. Attempting to quantize GR is like trying to explain the wood grain of a chessboard using the rules for how the pieces move.

True "unification" lies not in quantizing gravity, but in returning to the common origin that generates both "space" (the even-potential channel) and "force" (the odd-potential channel): **the unified potential series `Φ(r)` itself**. This offers a radical new direction for future research in unified physics.
